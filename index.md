# quick-react-ts
quick-react-ts is a collection of useful React components. You will find different components ranging from commonly used checkbox components to highly focused dashboard components.

## Installation
We recommend to clone this repository locally and build the current quick-react-ts version.
The quick-react-ts is also available on npm but there will not be any updates until we achieve beta stage.
You can build the library using the following commands:
>npm install

>npm run dev

## Showcase
To view currently available React components, clone this repository and run the following commands:
> npm install

> npm run dev

This will run webpack dev server on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). There you can see the showcase page and all currently available React components.

## Note
The quick-react-ts is in alpha stage, meaning some of the components are still work in progress.
